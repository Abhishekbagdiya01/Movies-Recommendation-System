## Movie Recommendation System with Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains the code for a movie recommendation system built using Jupyter Notebook.

# Getting Started-
This project utilizes a conda environment for managing dependencies. Here's how to get started:

    #Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Abhishekbagdiya01/Movies-Recommendation-System.git

    #Create and activate the conda environment:

    conda create movies_recommendation_system  
    source activate movies_recommendation_system 
    conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter notebook

    #This will create and activate a conda environment named movies_recommendation_system with the required dependencies installed.

    #Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook

    #This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then open and run the notebook file (e.g., movie_recommendation.ipynb) to train and use the recommendation system.


# Project Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using a content-based filtering approach. Content-based filtering recommends movies to users based on the similarity of the movies' features to the user's preferences.

This project uses the following Python libraries (listed in the conda-env.yml file):

    Pandas
    NumPy
    Scikit-learn 

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your activated conda environment.
